Hello future self. I know how you forget what you have done so I will explain.


To keep this project light you decided to make a build step which compiles all css and js files. Instead of automating this you decided to manually add files you want compiled and compressed.

You have separated these for individual parts of the site.

Main folder is for index.html and iwidget.html as they share the same style.

MobileApp folder is for mobile.html which works in the Lock+ Cydia app

Mobile is for ios.html which works in mobileSafari

Itâ€™s easy to build. Example would be cd into main and run ./build.sh compiled files will go into the creator/css and creator/js file.
